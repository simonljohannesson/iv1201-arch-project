# iv1201-arch-project

This is a project in the course iv1201 at kth.

## Decision log

### 2022-01-26 Should try to use one single git repository

The whole project can be accessed from a single place. If we decide to use microservices it could be easier to keep them in the same place, but no decision has been taken regarding microservices yet.

### 2022-01-26 Decision log should be in the projects git repository

It is easy for everyone to access the information.

### 2022-01-26 The branch master will not be locked from pushing directly

When working together it can be cumbersome to create a symbolic pull request which will be accepted without formal review. Everyone in the team has experience with working with git and github so the risk is considered minimal.
